# LiftSphere

A free, ad free workout tracker built with SwiftUI.

LiftSphere started as a personal project to build a clean and focused workout logging experience without ads, subscriptions, or unnecessary friction. It is designed to help you log workouts, track progress, and stay consistent.

## Why I Built This

After experimenting with AI tools and shipping quickly across different domains, I wanted to build something simple and useful that I would personally use every day. LiftSphere is the result.

It focuses on clarity, speed, and ownership of your data.
